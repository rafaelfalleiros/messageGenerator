# Message Generator

> A simple JavaScript script that generates random inspirational messages.

This script generates random messages by combining different subjects, verbs, and objects. Each time the script is run, a unique and inspiring message is displayed.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the `script.js` file in a JavaScript runtime environment or browser console.

3. Run the script and see a random inspirational message displayed.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the messages generated by the script:

- You have the potential to achieve greatness.
- Your efforts can make a difference.
- Your dreams will inspire others.

Feel free to modify the arrays in the script to customize the subjects, verbs, and objects used for generating messages. An idea to make the project more complex, is to prompt the user to write a message.
